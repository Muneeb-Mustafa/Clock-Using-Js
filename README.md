A simple Clock built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that dynamically displays the current time. The clock updates every second, showing hours, minutes, and seconds in real-time.

Features
Real-Time Display: Shows the current time (hours, minutes, and seconds) in real-time.
Responsive Design: The clock adjusts to different screen sizes for both desktop and mobile devices.
Digital Clock: Displays time in a clear, digital format (HH:MM
).
Automatic Update: The time updates automatically every second using JavaScript’s setInterval() function.
Technologies Used
HTML5 for structuring the clock display.
CSS3 for styling and layout.
JavaScript (ES6) for fetching the current time and updating the display in real-time.

How It Works
The Clock Using JavaScript project utilizes the Date object in JavaScript to fetch the current time. The setInterval() function is used to update the displayed time every second. The current hours, minutes, and seconds are dynamically inserted into the HTML using DOM manipulation.

Conclusion
This Clock Using JavaScript is a simple yet effective demonstration of how JavaScript can be used to create real-time applications. It’s a great way to practice DOM manipulation, CSS styling, and working with the Date object. Future improvements could include adding an analog clock, different time zones, or additional formatting options.
